# Acetabular-joint
This was an original acetabular-joint being redesigned from scratch, 3D-printed and also went through simulation under different loading conditions.
Project Overview

**Acetabular Joint** is a CAD and experimental project focused on the **hip joint and modular femoral implant design.** The project combines parametric **CAD modeling, finite element analysis (FEA), and additive manufacturing** to explore the geometric, mechanical, and manufacturability aspects of hip implants.

The goal is to provide an integrated workflow from design to simulation to 3D printing, demonstrating the efficiency and performance of different resolutions, materials, and printers.

**Features**

- **3D CAD Modeling:** Modular components including acetabular cap, liner, femoral head, and stem.

- **Finite Element Analysis:** Stress, strain, and deformation analysis under physiological loads using ANSYS.

- **3D Printing Evaluation:** Printed on Bambu Lab and Ultimaker 3 to assess print time, surface quality, and geometric fidelity.

- **Parametric Design:** Components designed in Fusion 360 for easy modification and testing.

**Technologies Used**

- **CAD Software:** Fusion 360

- **FEA Software:** ANSYS Workbench

- **3D Printing Platforms:** Bambu Lab, Ultimaker 3

- **Materials & Tools:** PLA/Resin (depending on printer), slicing software for print optimization
